Currently learning Minecraft Modding. Step 1 of figuring out how this work. What I have learned:
- Mod_ID = the name of the mod and what Minecraft recognizes as the game 
- Logger = Logs everything that happens in the Game.
- Gradle = The system that allows Minecraft to understand the code through the Forge API
- RegistryHandler = A registry of all blocks in Minecraft. Allows you to add new blocks to Minecraft through "...".registry(...). The main part you edit if you want blocks or items in Minecraft. 
- ItemBase and BlockBase: Creates the icon of the items in the new section of the inventory for the Mod.
- Tab: Creates the new section of the inventory of the MOD. 
- CreatIcon: Creates a icon.
